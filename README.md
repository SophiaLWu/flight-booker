# Flight Booker

This is a flight booker web app where users can search for one-way flights by
entering in desired dates/airports, choose a flight, and enter passenger
information for all passengers. 

See the app live [here](https://infinite-fortress-13459.herokuapp.com/).

This is a project described in [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/building-advanced-forms).
